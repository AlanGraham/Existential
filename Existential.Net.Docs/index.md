# **Existential.Net**
***The library for things that may or may not exist***

## Introduction
Existential helps with whether a value exists or not, or whether it 
exists in the desired form. It can be used to detect whether a value
exists or not and act on that or, even better, it can just help you not 
to care!

The two main classes for this are [Validate](xref:using_validate.md) and 
[Maybe&lt;T&gt;](xref:using_maybe.md).

## About the icon
Existential's icon consists of two symbols from 
[predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic): 
&#8707; (*there exists*) and &#8708; (*there does not exist*), the
[existential quantifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification).
