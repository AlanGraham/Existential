# **Existential.Net**

***The library for things that may or may not exist***


## Introduction
Existential helps with whether a value exists or not, or whether it 
exists in the desired form. It can be used to detect whether a value
exists or not and act on that or, even better, it can just help you not 
to care!

The two main classes for this are [Validate](xref:using_validate.md) 
(which will help you check) and 
[Maybe&lt;T&gt;](xref:using_maybe.md) which will help you not to care.

##  ![Existential icon](images/Existential32.png) About the icon

Existential's icon consists of two symbols from 
[predicate logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic): 
* &#8707; (*there exists*) and 
* &#8708; (*there does not exist*)

These are the two
[existential quantifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification)
, and captures the essence of what the Existential library is about.
