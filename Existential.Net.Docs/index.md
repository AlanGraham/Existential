# **Existential.Net**
***The library for things that may or may not exist***

## Introduction
Existential contains utilities for dealing with very fundamental issues,
such as whether a value exists or not, or whether it exists
in the desired form.

The two main classes for this are [Validate](xref:using_validate.md) and 
[Maybe&lt;T&gt;](xref:using_maybe.md).


## About the icon
The icon for Existential contains the two symbols for 
[existential quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification),
in predicate logic: &#8707; (there exists) and &#8708; (there does not exist).
